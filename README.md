This is a mobile-first web page that simulates the beginning of Bella Otér's Extern Body Profile experience.

## Features

## Bonus Features Implemented

## Time Spent
Approximately 2.5 hours was spent on this project:
- 30 minutes planning and setup
- 1 hour on HTML/CSS structure and styling
- 45 minutes on JavaScript functionality
- 15 minutes on polish and testing

## How to Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No additional setup is required.

## What I'd Improve With More Time
- Add animations for smoother transitions between states
- Implement a loading state for images
- Add more detailed product information
- Create a more sophisticated SVG logo
- Implement accessibility features more thoroughly
- Add unit tests for the JavaScript functionality
- Optimize image loading for better performance
